A Crossy Road inspired game made with Python and Turtle Languange. 
- random cars are spawned and are moving horizontally
- player ("turtle") should go to the finish line to move on to the next level without having a collission with the cars.
- everytime the player reaches the finish line, the level increases as well as the car's movement speed increases.
- if the player hits the car, the game is over.
